# IBJJF Bracket Layout Reverse Engineering

This note explains how we have been using real IBJJF brackets to refine
`_bracket_slots(n)` in `app/seeding.py`. It is intended for future agents or
maintainers continuing the work.

## Goal

`_bracket_slots(n)` returns first-round bracket rows as `(red_seed, blue_seed)`
pairs, with `None` for a bye. The output must match IBJJF's visual bracket rows
top-to-bottom closely enough that our estimated bracket can be compared against
their official viewer.

There are two distinct problems:

1. **Pairing geometry**: which low seed receives each play-in high seed.
2. **Visual row order**: how IBJJF renders the already-determined rows on the
   page.

Do not assume a mismatch is only display order. Several observed cases changed
the actual low seed used for play-ins.

## Current Implementation Shape

The implementation is in `app/seeding.py`:

- `_IBJJF_SEED_LAYOUTS` stores canonical power-of-two seed layouts.
- `_bracket_slots(n)` builds canonical first-round rows for the requested `n`.
- `_ibjjf_display_order(first_round, play_in_count)` converts canonical rows
  into IBJJF visual row order.
- `_side(seed, n)` uses `_bracket_slots(n)` but maps side `0` to the half
  containing seed `1`, even if seed `1` is visually lower on the page.

The frontend consumes backend-provided `bracket_slots`, so backend tests are the
main guardrail.

## Workflow For New Real Bracket Data

The current data-collection workflow is:

1. Search the IBJJF registration-by-division page for `total: N` to find a
   bracket size worth sampling.
2. Open the bracket page for that division.
3. Save the raw bracket page HTML to a local file, often
   `example_bracket.html`.
4. Run the helper script:

   ```bash
   python3 scripts/bracket_initial_pairings.py example_bracket.html
   ```

   The script parses the first-round seed rows from the saved IBJJF HTML. It
   also reads IBJJF's same-team swap list and maps swapped displayed seeds back
   to their original seed slots, which keeps the output useful for bracket
   generation analysis.
5. Paste the script output into the agent conversation for analysis.

When the user provides a bracket:

1. Normalize it as a list of rows:

   ```text
   N:
   seed,seed-or-bye
   seed,seed-or-bye
   ...
   ```

2. Compare pairings first, ignoring row order:

   - Extract all rows where both sides are real seeds.
   - Check whether those pairs already exist in our `_bracket_slots(N)`.
   - If the same pairs exist but in a different order, this is only display
     order.
   - If the pairs differ, update the play-in target selection before touching
     display order.

3. Only then compare visual order:

   - Treat the canonical layout as a tree.
   - Prefer transforms that move whole sibling rows or whole blocks.
   - Avoid changing row order for smaller brackets unless a smaller observed
     bracket requires it.

4. Add an exact regression test in `app/tests/test_seeding.py`:

   ```python
   def test_nXX_slots_match_ibjjf_visual_order(self):
       slots, size = _bracket_slots(XX)
       self.assertEqual(slots, [...])
       self.assertEqual(size, POWER_OF_TWO)
   ```

5. Add `N` to `test_all_seeds_present`.

6. Run:

   ```bash
   env PATH=/Users/will/.pyenv/shims:/opt/homebrew/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin make test
   ```

   The repo's `.python-version` points at the `ibjjf` pyenv. In this agent
   environment, plain `make test` may resolve `python3` to Homebrew Python
   instead of the pyenv shim.

## Observed Rules So Far

These are empirical rules from real IBJJF brackets, not official IBJJF
documentation.

### 4- and 8-slot brackets

Observed:

- `N=7`: `[(2,7), (3,5), (4,6), (1,bye)]`
- `N=8`: `[(2,7), (3,5), (4,6), (1,8)]`

Important: `N=7` uses the next power layout with seed `8` missing, rather than
the old effective-size-4 play-in fill.

### 16-slot brackets

Observed:

- `N=11`: `[(7,10), (2,bye), (5,9), (3,bye), (8,11), (1,bye), (4,bye), (6,bye)]`
- `N=16`: `[(5,9), (3,13), (7,11), (2,15), (8,12), (1,16), (6,10), (4,14)]`

`N=16` is still a single-page visual layout and should not use the larger
bracket page rhythm.

### 32-slot brackets

Observed:

- `N=20`

The display order follows a 4-row block rhythm over the 32-slot bracket:
inside each 4-row block, render `[row2, row1, row3, row4]`.

### 64-slot brackets

Observed:

- `N=33`
- `N=35`
- `N=36`
- `N=40`
- `N=44`
- `N=52`
- `N=55`

The play-in fill and display order change several times.

Known play-in target lows:

- `N=33..36`: first targets are `29, 30, 31, 32`.
- `N=40`: first full band gives `25-33` through `32-40`.
- `N=44`: observed low sequence is
  `17,18,19,20,29,30,31,32,25,26,27,28`.
- `N=52`: observed pairings are the standard 20-play-in fill:
  `17-33` through `32-48`, then `13-49` through `16-52`.
- `N=55`: observed late low sequence for `49..55` is
  `13,10,11,12,15,14,16`.

Display order is not a single global rule across all 64-slot sizes. The code
currently uses exact observed transforms for the known `play_in_count` values.
This is deliberate: avoid overgeneralizing from partial data.

### 128-slot brackets

Observed:

- `N=66`
- `N=72`

Known play-in target lows:

- `N=66`: `57-65`, `58-66`.
- `N=72`: first full band is `57-65` through `64-72`.

Known display order:

- `N=66`: block order is `(3,2,0,1,7,6,4,5)` over 8-row blocks, with row
  pair swapping only in active play-in blocks.
- `N=72`: every 8-row block renders `[row2, row1, row3, row4, row5, row6,
  row7, row8]`.

128-slot support is very provisional because only two bracket sizes are
available so far.

## Data Still Needed

Most useful future brackets:

- `N=34`, if available: confirms the second 64-slot target.
- `N=37..39`: fills the gap before the first complete 8-play-in band.
- `N=41..43`: tells whether the N=40 display rhythm holds until N=44.
- `N=45..48`: tells how the 12-play-in rule becomes a 16-play-in band.
- `N=53`, `N=54`, `N=56..64`: completes the late 64-slot behavior.
- Any `N=65..72` other than `66` and `72`: refines early 128-slot behavior.
- Any larger `N` if IBJJF has it, especially near powers of two.

## Safety Notes

- Keep changes narrowly scoped to the observed bracket-size band.
- Do not rewrite `_IBJJF_SEED_LAYOUTS` unless the canonical tree itself is
  proven wrong. Most changes should be in play-in target selection or display
  ordering.
- Preserve `_side(seed, n)` semantics: side `0` means seed `1`'s half; side
  `1` means seed `2`'s half. It should not mean visually top/bottom.
- Always add exact regression tests for pasted brackets.
- If a real bracket includes same-team swaps, compare displayed seed numbers,
  not athlete identities.
